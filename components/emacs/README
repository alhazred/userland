NAME:             emacs
VERSION:          23.4
DESCRIPTION:      GNU Emacs editor
LICENSE:          GPLv3
BUGTRAQ:          solaris/utility/emacs
COMMENTS:         

This file contains information about the emacs package within the Userland
consolidation. Along with the comments in the Makefile, it documents any
deviations from standard Userland or emacs practice, as well as miscellaneous
information needed to understand how this component is put together.


- We patch the following changes to the emacs sources:

	sysmalloc.patch
	    Use the system malloc instead of the built in one.

	dldump.patch
	    Use the native Solaris dldump() function (emacs/src/unexsol.c)
	    to produce the dumped emacs, rather than the generic ELF
	    code (emacs-xxx/src/unexelf.c).

	xft.patch
	    Patch configure script to provide necessary missing
	    libraries for the GTK version of emacs.

	eval_file_local_var.patch
	    When the Emacs user option `enable-local-variables' is set to
	    `:safe' (the default value is t), Emacs should automatically refuse
	    to evaluate `eval' forms in file-local variable sections. See:

		http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2012/08/13/1
		http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2012/08/13/2

	find.patch
	    The rgrep function uses the GNU-specific -path option to the
	    find command. Change the default value for the find-program
	    variable in grep.el to use GNU find.

	tty_startup_hang.patch
	    Emacs 23.x has a latent bug that causes it to run the X11 input
	    select code even when running without a window system via the
	    -nw option. This worked because a variable in libglib.so used
	    to be zero, but in newer versions of libglib.so it is not. The
	    result is that 'emacs -nw' hangs on startup and has to be killed
	    from another shell. This is fixed in eamcs 24.2. See:

		http://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/bugreport.cgi?bug=9754

- Emacs can be built as either 32-bit or 64-bit, depending on the target
  machine. The benefit of a 64-bit emacs is that the size of the files it
  can handle is not limited to 128MB, as it is with the 32-bit version.

  For Solaris, we used to build both versions, using /usr/lib/isaexec to
  run the 64-bit version if possible, and the 32-bit version otherwise. Note
  that this was only done for the emacs binary itself, as there is no
  technical need for 64-bit versions of the ancillary programs that come
  with emacs (etags, emacsclient, etc).

  Fortunately, the vast majority of the files in an emacs tree are identical,
  regardless of the platform and/or word size, which makes this particularly
  easy to do.

  With Solaris 11, all kernels are 64-bit, and we therefore do not need
  the 32-bit executables. As such, we only supply 64-bit emacs binaries now,
  and the use of usr/lib/isaexec has been removed: This cuts the number of
  builds necessary in half, and also the binary package size. It also
  simplifies packaging, and the user's view of /usr/bin/emacs*.

- There are three different toolkit options: None, Athena widgets
  (aka Xaw, or lucid), and gtk. It would be nice to only support gtk,
  but for purposes of minimization and user preference, we supply binaries
  for all three. We follow the Linux model in this regard. The Xaw and no-X
  versions are quite stable from release to release, so this isn't a large
  burden.

- We deliver the following packages:

	gnu-emacs - Everything you need to run emacs, except the
	    emacs binaries.

	gnu-emacs-gtk - Binaries for the X11 version using the GTK toolkit.

	gnu-emacs-no-x11 - Pure tty emacs binaries, built without
	    any X11 linkage. Ideal for headless server systems.

	gnu-emacs-x11 - Binaries for the X11 version using the Athena
	    widget (Xaw) toolkit.

	gnu-emacs-lisp - The compressed LISP files for which compiled
	    versions are delivered by gnu-emacs. These are only needed
	    for emacs developers and those who like to read source code.

  The core gnu-emacs package is required by all of the other packages.
  In turn, gnu-emacs requires at least one of the packages supplying an
  emacs binary to be installed.

- We do not ship any suid/sgid binaries for obvious security reasons.

  We do not install the files under /var/games/emacs. The reason for
  this is that we do not install update-game-score as setuid, and
  therefore the game files are not usable. This the same decision made
  by Debian, among others.
